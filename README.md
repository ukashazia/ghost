### A CLI tool that simulates the 'active' behavior in MacOS

- It sends 'blank' keystrokes & mouse clicks after a preconfigured period of inactivity. 
- The program is paused when there's any mouse/keyboard activity.

``` bash
brew install --cask ukashazia/ghost/ghost
```

allow the app in `System Settings` -> `Privacy & Security`

``` bash
ghost -h
```
